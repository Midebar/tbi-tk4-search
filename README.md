The frontend is created using NPM React base template

Hosted in free time-limited AWS EC2, so it needs to be reinstated and re-setup everytime (every 180 mins of free time)

Then access with DuckDNS domain, which needs to be updated with new IP address with every new setup

## First run: 
docker-compose build

## Then run:
docker-compose up -d
